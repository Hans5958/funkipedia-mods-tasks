## Background

[From the feedback](https://gist.github.com/Hans5958/9aee0e5ae53128f3ffb47ed03e87e9a8#the-modcharacter-ambiguity):

> There are some pages that for some reason only have the character of the song, but not the mod, or is it the other way around, or both at the same time, or what? My point is that some pages have this kind of ambiguity. Probably a due diligence, but sure it could make confusion for usual Fandom users, who expect separate pages of, for example, [the series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants), [the character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)), [the franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(franchise)), etc.
>
> Here's a good example. We got [Hex](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Hex) as a character, and [VS. Hex](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/VS._Hex) as a mod. Looks good and it is expected. 
> 
> But then we got [Tabi](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Tabi) as a character, but no pages of the mod, or [Garcello](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Garcello), but not the mod. And then it has links of the mod, which means it is also the mod page? Unlike your general mod page, there is no credits fields in the Mod infobox, so it seems quite unfair to me.
>
> My suggestion: Separate, or differentiate, these kind of mods to have both the mod as a page and the character as a page. (ie. page with the mod can have its complete information of the mod, like notices, attribution, download links, and such, and the character can have its complete information as a character, like something written on the usual character section, only in a separate page)
